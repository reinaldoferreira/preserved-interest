<ul>
<li><a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a></li>
<li><a href="http://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a></li>
<li><a href="http://harpjs.com/">Harp</a></li>
</ul>
<p>But for me I decided to go with rolling my own static site generator solution, mostly because I&#39;m not smart enough to stop myself from reinventing to wheel and also because it&#39;s fun building things xD</p>
<p>The main idea around the solution I built was that I wanted to be able to add assets easily to single posts. Basically the idea is that when I create a folder inside of content/posts all assets within that folder are available in the markdown file associated to it.</p>
<p>So for example if I added an image to the content/posts/my-post/ folder with the name of my-image.jpg I can reference that image from within the markdown file with [my-image.jpg]. On building the solution with npm run build the image would be moved into an image folder in the dist folder.</p>
<p>Something else that&#39;s different from other static site generators I&#39;ve seen is that I setup a config.json file that is added to the json file created from the markdown files which is passed to the views. I dont automatically generate any list structures. All the json out is doing is creating properties in an object with a key of the file path and a value of the files contents. Then by manually updating the config.json you can add lists and other global variables referencing content objects.</p>
<p>If you need to add a large number of files to a list then this solution is a bit tedious, but I liked the flexibility of it.</p>
<p>Also in the future I&#39;ll add a cli for generating markdown files and updating the configs accordingly.</p>
